### Testing data
This repo consists of the input used for testing the algorithms in my paper.
test1 : consists of data used to test on an algorithm that works on one block of elements.
test2 : consists of data used to test on an algorithm that works on global memory (GPU) and CPU. 
test3 : conststs of data used to test on an algorithm that utilizes shared memory (GPU) and CPU.

Since the input files for test2 and test3 are close to 1.5 GB, the main files of each directory can be run to get the input data.
