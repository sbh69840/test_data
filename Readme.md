This repo consists of the input used for testing the algorithms in my paper.
test1 : consists of data used to test on an algorithm that works on one block of elements.
test2 : consists of data used to test on an algorithm that works on global memory (GPU) and CPU. 
test3 : conststs of data used to test on an algorithm that utilizes shared memory (GPU) and CPU.
